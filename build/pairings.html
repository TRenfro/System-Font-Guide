                    Pairing typefaces is <em>hard</em>. That said, there are a few sure-fire ways to ensure than you get
                    harmonic pairings that’ll suit your content well. My first step tends to be establishing a voice and
                    tone; for instance, the tone of this particular pairing is intended to be formal and classic.
                </p>
                <p class="type-sm mg-bottom-md georgia">
                    Once you know what voice you want your content to carry, you should go about finding a body font. In this case, Hoefler Text
                    is a great choice for a body font that is formal and classic. A nice pairing for Hoefler Text is Requiem
                    Display, sharing similarities with the body font of choice whilst bringing a lot of character to the
                    table itself.

                    Let’s jump back a second and get practical again. Let’s say we’re dead set on having a contrasted pairing for our content;
                    great. But how do we do that? Do we just throw together a classic serif face with a big, bold headline?
                    I don’t think so. That’s a recipe for typographic disaster.

                    have picked up from a fairly wide array of resources.

                    I can sit here and give you techniques for pairing typefaces for hours, but what it really comes down to is <strong>your gut.</strong>                    It’s an art, not a science. The most important thing to remember is to use <em>appropriate typefaces.</em>                    You wouldn’t set a legal document in Comic Sans. Or at least, I hope you wouldn’t.
